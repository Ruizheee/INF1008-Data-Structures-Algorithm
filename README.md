Currently, this python file makes use of dash to create the webpage for users and folium to generate the map. 

Upon running the python file, a web page will be created on ur localhost, and when you access the webpage, there is currently just a blank input box for users to type in the hotel that they would like to go (E.g. the warehouse hotel) (case-insensitive). Once the user clicks on the submit button, a map will be generated and a new web page will be created bringing the user there. 

Now, for the map, there are two cursor colors, the red one would be the starting point (Changi Airport) while the black ones are the hotels. 

Note: This is not the final product, and there are still alot of changes to be made.
